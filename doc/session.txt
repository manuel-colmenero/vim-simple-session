INTRODUCTION                                    *simple-session*

Simple session is a straightforward, no hassle plugin for handling named
sessions in VIM.

Just type away |:Session| {name} for creating new sessions or switching to
old sessions. |:SList|, |:SDelete| and |:SQuit| pretty much do what they
promise. Commands that take an argument support autocompletion.

Sessions are automatically saved when VIM is closed or an old session is
opened up.

If present, this plugin also integrates with vim-fugitive (|:SGit| for going
to a sesion named like the current git branch), and also with CtrlP,
|:CtrlPSession| enables a mode to switch between sessions (you need to enable
the extension first, see |:CtrlPSession|).

This plugin is just a wrapper for |:mksession|, so check out 'sessionoptions'
for choosing what VIM stores in the session. I suggest removing `blank`, which
is basically useless; and specially `options`, in order to prevent stale options
in sessions.

You can also add an indicator to your status bar with |session#statusbar()|.
Some more functions are detailed in |simple-session-scripting|.

COMMANDS                                        *simple-session-commands*

                                                *simple-session-:Session*
:Session [{session}]    With no arguments, it displays the current session
                        (if any).

                        With a session name it will:
                        - Create a new session if it doesn't exist. Or
                        - Just switch to that session.

                        Windows are preserved if there's no previous session
                        open and the session doesn't exist, allowing to save
                        the current layout.

                        If there's an active session it'll be saved and
                        closed.

                                                *simple-session-:SList*
:SList                  Lists sessions, the current one marked with an
                        asterisk (if any).

                                                *simple-session-:SQuit*
:SQuit                  Saves the session and closes all the buffers.

                                                *simple-session-:SDelete*
:SDelete [{session}]    Without an argument, closes and deletes the current
                        session.

                        With an argument, it deletes the given session. It can
                        take more than one argument. If the name of the
                        current session is passed, it'll be also closed.

                                                *simple-session-:SGit*
:SGit                   Calls |:Session| with the name of the current git
                        branch as parameter.

                        This command currently requires vim-fugitive to be
                        installed to work.

                                                *simple-session-:CtrlPSession*
:CtrlPSession           Open up CtrlP with a list of saved sessions. Pick one
                        to switch to it. Current session (if any) is stored.

                        For this to work you have (of course) to have CtrlP
                        installed and also add this to your .vimrc: >
                            let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['session']
                        <

OPTIONS                                         *simple-session-options*

                                                *simple-session-g:session_dir*
g:session_dir           string (default "~/.vim_sessions/")

                        Specifies where the VIM session files are to be
                        stored.

STATUSLINE                                      *simple-session-statusline*

                                                *session#statusline()*
Add %{session#statusline()} to your 'statusline' option to get an indicator of
the current session (if any). Example:
>
    set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%{session#statusline()}%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<

SCRIPTING                                       *simple-session-scripting*

Some useful functions for using along the commands when writing own "session
aware" scripts.

                                                *session#active()*
session#active()        Boolean
                        Returns true if there is an active session, false
                        otherwise.

                                                *session#current()*
session#current()       String
                        Returns the name of the current session, empty string
                        if no current session open.

                                                *session#list()*
session#list()          Array
                        Returns an array with all the available sessions.
