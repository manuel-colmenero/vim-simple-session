# vim-simple-session

Simple session is a straightforward, no hassle plugin for handling named
sessions in VIM.

Just type away `:Session {name}` for creating new sessions or switching to
old sessions. `:SList`, `:SDelete` and `:SQuit` pretty much do what they
promise. Commands that take an argument support autocompletion.

Sessions are automatically saved every time a new buffer is created, when VIM is
closed or an old session is opened up.

If present, this plugin also integrates with vim-fugitive (`:SGit` for going
to a sesion named like the current git branch), and also with CtrlP,
`:CtrlPSession` enables a mode to switch between sessions (you need to enable
the extension first, see documentation `:h simple-session-:CtrlPSession`).

This plugin is just a wrapper for `:mksession`, so check out `'sessionoptions'`
for choosing what VIM stores in the session. I suggest removing `blank`, which
is basically useless; and specially `options`, in order to prevent stale options
in sessions.

Including a statusline indicator is also possible adding
`%{session#statusline()}` to the `'statusline'` option.
